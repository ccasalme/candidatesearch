# Candidate Search App

## Description
The **Candidate Search App** is a web application that allows recruiters to search for potential candidates using the GitHub API. Users can browse through candidates, save promising profiles, and manage a list of saved candidates. The app is built with React, TypeScript, and uses local storage to persist saved candidates.

## Features
âœ” **Candidate Browsing:** View a random GitHub user's details upon page load.  
âœ” **Candidate Search:** Enter a GitHub username to fetch specific user data.  
âœ” **Save Candidates:** Click the `+` button to add a candidate to the saved list.  
âœ” **Skip Candidates:** Click the `-` button to skip a candidate without saving.  
âœ” **Saved Candidates Page:** View and manage saved candidates.  
âœ” **Persistent Storage:** Saved candidates remain even after page refresh.  
âœ” **Error Handling:** Displays appropriate messages when no candidates are found or available.
